[Intro: Fatman Scoop]
Music make you lose control
Music make you lose control
Let's go
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Here we go now, here we go now
Here we go now, here we go now
(Music make you lose control)
Misdemeanor's in the house, yeah
Ciara's in the house
Misdemeanor's in the house
Fatman Scoop-man, Scoop-man, Scoop

[Verse 1: Missy Elliott & Fatman Scoop]
I got a cute face, chubby waist (Mhm)
Thick legs, in shape (Let's go, c'mon)
Rump shakin', both ways (C'mon now)
Make you do a double take (Now let's go y'all, woo)
Planet Rocker, show stopper
Flow proper, head knocker (Yeah)
Beat scholar, tail dropper
Do my thang, motherfuckers (Now let's go)
My Rolls Royce, Lamborghini (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
Blue Madina, always beamin' (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
Rag top, chrome pipes (Bring it back now)
Blue lights, outta sight (Now bring it back)
(Long weave) sewed in (Walk it out)
(Say it again) sewed in (Walk it out)
Make that money, throw it in (Woo!)
Booty bouncin', go'n 'head (Hands up!)
